"Diagnostics are the UX of a compiler, and so they're deserving of the
exact same care that is put into mobile app or Web design."

## 2015-04-20 - Quote of the Week

"`unsafe` restricts which code could contain undefined behavior, but it doesn't isolate the effects of that undefined behavior." - [kmc on the limits of unsafety](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/32wqa7/wip_llamadb_a_simple_sql_database_written_in_rust/cqfoh41).

```

Ms2ger in #rust.

Thanks to bluss for the tip.


## 2015-05-04 - Quote of the Week

*"Ultimately, I think this all boils down to the fact that borrowck only cares about reachable
values. A leaked value isn't reachable, therefore it doesn't matter
that it had a lifetime associated with it and technically outlives that
lifetime, since it's not reachable no undefined behavior can be invoked."*

[Insight from kballard on the safety of linking](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1084#issuecomment-96875651).

Thanks to Gankro for the tip.


## 2015-05-18 - Quote of the Week

*"Yes, because laundry eating has evolved to be a specific design goal now; and the initial portions of the planned laundry eating API have been landed behind the #![feature(no_laundry)] gate. no_laundry should become stable in 6-8 weeks, though the more complicated portions, including DRY cleaning, Higher Kinded T-shirts, Opt-in Builtin Detergent, and Rinse Time Optimization will not be stabilized until much later."*

*"We hope this benefits the Laundry as a Service community immensely."*

Manish [explains](http://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/35vyej/10_stable_is_nearly_here/cr8pxi2) Rust's roadmap for laundry-eating.

Thanks to filsmick for the tip.

And since there were so many quotables in the last two weeks, here's one from
[Evan Miller's evaluation of Rust](http://www.evanmiller.org/a-taste-of-rust.html):

*"Rust is a systems language. I’m not sure what that term means, but it
seems to imply some combination of native code compilation, not being
Fortran, and making no mention of category theory in the documentation."*

Thanks to ruudva for the tip.


## 2015-06-08 - Quote of the Week

*"Dude, you can't just tell people it's the secret plan; then it won't be a secret any more! You keep this up, and you're going to get your Secret Rust Club card revoked! Then you won't be able to get on the awesome Secret Rust Zeppelin. Don't screw this up, man!"*

Quxxy, from [/r/rust](http://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/36z2n0/rust_made_me_a_worse_c_programmer_right/cribpl5).

*"The 1st rule of Secret Rust Club is: you don't talk about Secret Rust Club.*

*The 2nd rule of Secret Rust Club is: error: `1st rule` does not live long enough.*

*error: aborting due to previous error"*

JakDrako, from the same thread.

Thanks to drbawb and Manishearth for the tip.


## 2015-06-15 - Quote of the Week

```text
<Quxxy> I had a fun one in cargo script: there's currently no way in Rust
to get a file's mtime and the system time in the same time format
<Quxxy> (On Windows)
<Quxxy> You can get one in UNIX time, the other in Windows time
<Quxxy> Which have different scales and different epochs

<bluss> I've tried using unchecked indexing in non-trivial code now a couple of times. It never makes a big difference

## 2015-12-07 - Quote of the Week

> The major philosophic difference between Rust today and Swift-as-I-envision-it is that Rust forces you to think about ownership everywhere, but Swift-as-I-envision-it should only force you to think about single ownership & borrowing if you want to optimize performance or guarantee that you have no encounters with the runtime.

> If it helps, think of the extant Swift "inout" parameter modifier as being equivalent to "&mut", and imagine the logical swift extensions to support the rest of the Rust model.

> This is a really important area for us to develop, but it also isn't the highest priority of the team. That means that Rust will maintain a lead in this area of applicability... unless someone motivated and capable from the open source community decides that it is really important to them, and makes it happen sooner.

— [peterjoel on /r/rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/4084yx/my_trick_when_i_get_stuck_as_a_beginner/cysqz3s).

Thanks to [Wa Delma](https://users.rust-lang.org/users/WaDelma) for the suggestion.


## 2016-01-25 - Quote of the Week

> Memory errors are fundamentally state errors, and Rust's move semantics, borrowing, and aliasing XOR mutating help enormously for me to reason about how my program changes state as it executes, to avoid accidental shared state and side effects at a distance. Rust more than any other language I know enables me to do compiler driven design. And internalizing its rules has helped me design better systems, even in other languages.

> I want to paint you a picture of a utopia in which Rust has expanded to become the fabric of the entire classical computing world, where the possibilities of what we can achieve are not shackled to the decaying dreams of computer science past. In this perfect utopia you have invented the perfect model for managing your computer's sci-fi hardware, perfectly free from the legacy of Unix and Windows. And you need the perfect language to write it in. Everywhere you look is legacy: C, C++, Java; the stacks get bigger and bigger, cruft all the way down.

> The only shining light is Rust. Those Rustaceans have been chipping away the cruft, distilling their platform to only the essence of bits and bytes, while also expanding its expressive power toward legendary elegance. Rust doesn't want to tell you how to build your system. Rust wants to serve you, to fulfill your dreams, on your terms. For your ambitions, Rust is the only reasonable choice in a world filled with compromises.

> I really hate the phrase "fighting". Calling it a fight doesn't do justice to the conversations you have with the borrow checker when you use Rust every day. You don't fight with the borrow checker, because there isn't a fight to win. It's far more elegant, more precise. It's fencing; you fence with the borrow checker, with ripostes and parries and well-aimed thrusts. And sometimes, you get to the end and you realize you lose anyway because the thing you were trying to do was fundamentally wrong. And it's okay, because it's just fencing, and you're a little wiser, a little better-honed, a little more practiced for your next bout.

> It had been decades since the last line of C code was erased, and the last C compiler (written, ironically (but unsurprisingly), in Rust) engraved onto a golden disc and launched toward that distant star around which the GooglePepsiMusk Sphere's construction could be faintly observed. To even utter that fell syllable would be met with swift retaliation from the paramilitary _Borrow Xekkers_ (the alphabet as well having been altered to better suit this shining memory-safe utopia). The whole world, everything, had all been rewritten in Rust, and at last the world knew universal peace and prosperity of boundless proportion.

> And thus did The Great Schism rend interstellar civilization in twain.

> There was but one ray of hope. As the fires of war rushed toward the newly-completed GooglePepsiMusk Sphere, its cadre of elite 10<sup>10x</sup> programmers set to work. Their task: to write the most advanced compound artificial intelligence ever known, one capable of averting the catastrophe consuming the universe: _AlexKryton.exe_<sup>[1]</sup> . Due to Rust's incredible productivity benefits, they completed their task in a mere 22 seconds--and thanks to the Rust compiler's incredible performance, spent only nine months waiting for it compile.

And so you might not want to hang out with them all the time, but if you need something blown up he is there for you.

> Beware travellers, lest you venture into waters callous and unforgiving, where hope must abandoned, ere it is cruelly torn from you. For here stands the bastion of the Turbofish: an impenetrable fortress holding unshaking against those who would dare suggest the supererogation of the Turbofish.
>
> Once I was young and foolish and had the impudence to imagine that I could shake free from the coils by which that creature had us tightly bound. I dared to suggest that there was a better way: a brighter future, in which Rustaceans both new and old could be rid of that vile beast. But alas! In my foolhardiness my ignorance was unveiled and my dreams were dashed unforgivingly against the rock of syntactic ambiguity.
>
> This humble program, small and insignificant though it might seem, demonstrates that to which we had previously cast a blind eye: an ambiguity in permitting generic arguments to be provided without the consent of the Great Turbofish. Should you be so naïve as to try to revolt against its mighty clutches, here shall its wrath be indomitably displayed. This program must pass for all eternity, fundamentally at odds with an impetuous rebellion against the Turbofish.

> Right.  I've never even used this impl, but my first thought upon seeing the question "I have an `Iterator` of `X` and need a `Y`" was to look at the `FromIterator` impls of `Y`.
>
> If that impl *didn't* exist, I'd then look for the following:

> * Other `FromIterator<X>` impls for `String` to see if any of those `X` can easily be produced from `char` (and then I would call `map` before `.collect()`).

> * `impl Add<char> for String`.  If this existed, I would use `.fold(String::new(), |s, c| s + c)`
> * methods of [char](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.char.html) to see if there's anything that lets you obtain the UTF8 bytes.  Indeed, there is `encode_utf8`, which even gives a `&mut str`, so one can write

>       s += &*c.encode_utf8(&mut buffer);

> Say the same thing about seatbelts in a car. If you don’t plan to have accidents, why do you need seatbelts?
>
> Car accidents, like mistakes in programming are a risk that has a likelihood that is non-zero. A seatbelt might be a little bit annoying when things go well, but much less so when they don’t. Rust is there to stop you in most cases when you try to accidentally shot yourself into the leg, unless you deliberately without knowing what you are doing while yelling “hold my beer” (unsafe). And contrary to popular belief even in unsafe blocks many of Rust’s safety guarantees hold, just not all.
>
> …
>
> Just like with the seatbelt, there will be always those that don’t wear one for their very subjective reasons (e.g. because of edge cases where a seatbelt could trap you in a burning car, or because it is not cool, or because they hate the feeling and think accidents only happen to people who can’t drive).

## 2019-03-05 - Quote of the Week

And again, we have two quotes for the week:

> > Can you eli5 why TryFrom and TryInto matters, and why it’s been stuck for so long ? (the RFC seems to be 3 years old)
>
> If you stabilise Try{From,Into}, you also want implementations of the types in std. So you want things like impl TryFrom<u8> for u16. But that requires an error type, and that was (I believe) the problem.
>
> u8 to u16 cannot fail, so you want the error type to be !. Except using ! as a type isn’t stable yet. So use a placeholder enum! But that means that once ! is stabilised, we’ve got this Infallible type kicking around that is redundant. So change it? But that would be breaking. So make the two isomorphic? Woah, woah, hold on there, this is starting to get crazy…
>
> *new person bursts into the room* “Hey, should ! automatically implement all traits, or not?”
>
> “Yes!” “No!” “Yes, and so should all variant-less enums!”
>
> Everyone in the room is shouting, and the curtains spontaneously catching fire. In the corner, the person who proposed Try{From,Into} sits, sobbing. It was supposed to all be so simple… but this damn ! thing is just ruining everything.
>
> … That’s not what happened, but it’s more entertaining than just saying “many people were unsure exactly what to do about the ! situation, which turned out to be more complicated than expected”.

> Just the presence of well integrated Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) makes an incredible amount of difference. They are used to represent errors in a meaningful and easy to understand way (`Result<T>`), are used to show that a function may or may not return a meaningful value without needing a garbage value (`Option<T>`), and the optional case can even be used to wrap a null pointer scenario in a safe way (`Option<Ref<T>>` being the closest to a literal translation I think).

> That’s just one small feature that permeates the language. Whatever the opposite of a death-of-a-thousand-cuts is, Rust has it.

> Well, let me tell you: unless your code is cooler than ICE, the compiler does not miss anything. Rust accompanies us at each step of our path, very gently pulling our hand when we are too close to falling onto a (safety) hole, and also very gently letting us fall all the way down the hole, as soon we spell the forbidden incantation: `unsafe`.

## 2019-12-31 - Quote of the Week

> Rust has multiple *unique* paradigms that don't even exist in other languages, such as lifetimes and compile-time-tracked "exclusive access". But instead of endorsing them from the beginning, as @mbrubeck's [ *Rust: a unique perspective* ](https://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2019/02/07/rust-a-unique-perspective.html) does, the Rust book tries to show a language that is "like other languages, but with (magical) compile-time checks". When the truth is that Rust's strength lies in non-`unsafe` Rust being **less expressive** than languages like C or C++.
>
> I think that Rust should start with the statement: "Welcome to a language that by being less expressive forces you to use constructs that are **guaranteed at compile-time to be sound**. But don't worry; after some time you will get used to the coding patterns that are allowed, and will then almost not notice the hindered expressiveness, only the enhanced zero-cost safety that will let you **hack without fear**."
>
> * It doesn't sound bad imho, and is at least honest *w.r.t.* the struggles that someone refusing to shift their way of coding / mental coding patterns may encounter.

## 2020-02-04 - Quote of the Week

> People argue about the color of a bike shed because even though it's a meaningless decision - it's still a decision that has to be made. The null choice is a very bad choice - if you don't paint the shed it'll rust. And there is no "default color" so you can't just say "just color it" - you have to pick a color.
>
> Even seen someone argue about the **pattern** of the shed's paint? No. The pattern is not any more meaningful than the color, but unlike the color - there is a null choice. There is a default. Solid paint. And because there is a default, no one even thinks about using something else because why are you wasting company time and money on a pattern for a bike shed?
>
> From my personal experience, when there is a default and the default is good enough, nobody bikesheds how to derive from the default. They only discuss it when there is a concrete problem with the default, where is doesn't fit your needs for whatever reason. And when you do have a concrete reason to derive from the default - you will derive from the default. Because you have to. And if the library does not support it - you'll switch the library.
>
> Because you have to.

## 2020-02-11 - Quote of the Week

This week we have two (related) quotes:

> **Even with just basic optimization, Rust was able to outperform the hyper hand-tuned Go version.** This is a huge testament to how easy it is to write efficient programs with Rust compared to the deep dive we had to do with Go.
>
> [..] After a bit of profiling and performance optimizations, **we were able to beat Go on every single performance metric** . Latency, CPU, and memory were all better in the Rust version.

– [Jesse Howard on the discord blog](https://blog.discordapp.com/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust-a190bbca2b1f)

> The consistency angle really shouldn’t be overlooked. Performance is nice, but slow and consistent can still be planned for much more easily than inconsistent.
>
> That was the big aha moment about Rust for me when I pushed out my first project using the language. Being nervous about it I had added way too much instrumentation so that I could know how every bit of it was responding to real traffic. But as soon as I started seeing the data, I was convinced that my instrumentation code was broken. The graphs I was seeing were just so...boring. Straight lines everywhere, no variation...after 24hrs, the slowest response (not P99...literally P100) was within 75ms of the fastest response.

> Rust is funny because in one sense it's hard and clunky. However, it's only ever *precisely as hard and clunky as it needs to be*. Everywhere something can be made more concise, or readable, or convenient, without sacrificing any control, it has been. Anytime something is hard or inconvenient, it's because the underlying domain really is exactly that hard or inconvenient.

> References are a sharp tool and there are roughly three different approaches to sharp tools.
>
> 1. Don't give programmers sharp tools. They may make mistakes and cut their fingers off. *This is the Java/Python/Perl/Ruby/PHP... approach.*
> 2. Give programmers all the sharp tools they want. They are professionals and if they cut their fingers off it's their own fault. *This is the C/C++ approach.*
> 3. Give programmers sharp tools, but put guards on them so they can't accidentally cut their fingers off. *This is Rust's approach.*
>
> Lifetime annotations are a safety guard on references. Rust's references have no sychronization and no reference counting -- that's what makes them sharp. References in category-1 languages (which typically *do* have synchronization and reference counting) are "blunted": they're not really *quite* as effective as category-2 and -3 references, but they don't cut you, and they still work; they might just slow you down a bit.

## 2020-08-25 - Quote of the Week

> Rust is a very different beast for me. It is a *much* bigger and *much* more capable language. However, I've found that it is, in many ways, a lot more restrictive in how you can approach problems. I frequently find myself being perplexed at how to eloquently solve a problem. When I discover the idiomatic way of doing it I'm usually both blown away by the brilliance of it and a bit disheartened by how difficult it would be to come up with that solution by myself :-).

## 2020-09-16 - Quote of the Week

> When you have a lifetime `<'a>` on a struct, that lifetime denotes references to values stored *outside* of the struct. If you try to store a reference that points inside the struct rather than outside, you will run into a compiler error when the compiler notices you **lied** to it.

## 2020-12-23 - Quote of the Week

> It took me sometime to let go and embrace getting things working before optimizing. It was a major breakthrough on that journey when I realized that ALL my python variables are `Rc<RefCell<_>>` , so any chance I had to make a variable that was less complicated than that was already a big optimization. If 1/10 Rust variables had to be that complicated it would not feel good, but it would already be 90% better. So if 1/50 make the code ezere to read and maintain then do it!

## 2021-01-20 - Quote of the Week

> Why do I use the letter ‘o’ for my generic closure param name? [...] I recently realized that since Rust uses pipes to enclose a param block, using ‘o’ makes the block look like a TIE fighter. I am not a terribly serious person.

## 2021-02-03 - Quote of the Week

This time we had two very good quotes, I could not decide, so here are both:

> What I have been learning ... was not Rust in particular, but how to write sound software in general, and that in my opinion is the largest asset that the rust community tough me, through the language and tools that you developed.
>
> Under this prism, it was really easy for me to justify the step learning curve that Rust offers: I wanted to learn how to write sound software, writing sound software is really hard , and the Rust compiler is a really good teacher.
>
> \[...\]
>
> This ability to identify unsound code transcends Rust's language, and in my opinion is heavily under-represented in most cost-benefit analysis over learning Rust or not.

– [Jorge Leitao on rust-users](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/thank-you-for-the-teaching-on-how-to-write-sound-software/54714)

and

> Having a fast language is not enough (ASM), and having a language with strong type guarantees neither (Haskell), and having a language with ease of use and portability also neither (Python/Java). Combine all of them together, and you get the best of all these worlds.
>
> Rust is not the best option for any coding philosophy, it’s the option that is currently the best at combining all these philosophies.

## 2021-02-10 - Quote of the Week

> The main theme of Rust *is not* systems programming, speed, or memory safety - it's moving runtime problems to compile time. Everything else is incidental. This is an invaluable quality of any language, and is something Rust greatly excels at.

## 2021-02-17 - Quote of the Week

> Have you seen someone juggle several items with one hand? That's the point of async. Blocking (non-async) it like writing - it requires constant work from each hand. If you want to write twice as fast you'll need two hands and write with both at the same time. That's multithreading. If you juggle, the moment the item leaves your hand and is in the air, you have it left with nothing to do. That's similar to network IO - you make a request and are just waiting for the server to respond. You could be doing something in the meantime, like catching another item and throwing it back up again. That's what "await" does - it says I threw and item into the air, so I want my current thread / hand to switch over to catch something else now.

## 2021-02-24 - Quote of the Week

> Finally, I feel it is necessary to debunk the “*fighting the borrow checker*” legend, a story depicting the Rust compiler as a boogeyman: in my experience, it happens mostly to beginners and the 1% trying to micro-optimize code or push the boundaries. Most experienced Rust developers know exactly how to model their code in a way that no time is wasted fighting the compiler on design issues, and can spot anti-patterns at a glance, just like most people know how to drive their car on the correct side of the road to avoid accidents, and notice those who don’t!

## 2021-03-17 - Quote of the Week

> I think the security of the internet is incredibly important obviously and I want it to be secure and I think bringing rust there is absolutely going to help it. Just by default it eliminates some of the most classic types of vulnerabilities.
>
> But I don't think that's the most exciting part. I think the most exciting part is that the set of people for whom it is possible to implement these types of things, like who writes coreutils, who writes curl, who does those things. That used to be a really small pool of people. That had to be people who knew the dark arts, and only them and only their buddies or something.
>
> **And it's the goal of rust to empower that to be a larger group of people** and ultimately I think that that is what is going to happen which means the sheer number of people will be larger, and also the diversity of that set of people is going to grow. And I that that that will probably actually do more for the security and usefulness of these tools than eliminating undefined behaviour.

## 2021-03-31 - Quote of the Week

> Despite all the negative aspects, I must say that I do generally really like the poll-based approach that Rust is taking. Most of the problems encountered are encountered not because of mistakes, but because no other language really has pushed this principle this far. Programming language design is first and foremost an “artistic” activity, not a technical one, and anticipating the consequences of design choices is almost impossible.

## 2021-05-05 - Quote of the Week

> Using R or Numpy is like driving around in a sports car. You just turn the wheel, press the pedals, and burn rubber. Rust (and other systems languages) are like getting a spaceship. You can go places and do things that you never dreamt of in a car. They are harder to pilot, but the possibilities seem unlimited! With the Rust ecosystem still in development, it feels like parts of your spaceship come in boxes of parts labeled "some assembly required".

## 2021-06-02 - Quote of the Week

> I recently graduated with my Ph.D., after having worked on 5 different versions of my simulator, written in 4 different languages. The last version, written in pure, safe rust, worked correctly in part because of rust's strong guarantees about what 'safety' means, which I was able to leverage to turn what would normally be runtime errors into compile time errors. That let me catch errors that would normally be days or weeks of debugging into relatively simple corrections. \[...\] So, once again, thank you to everyone!

## 2021-06-09 - Quote of the Week

> As the tradeoffs in software engineering change over time, so does the ideal solution. Some 40 years ago when the first C standards were written down, by people no less competent than those that work on Rust today, the design of the language and the list of behaviours not defined likely made much more sense in context of back then than they do right now. It is not all that unlikely that some years down the line the choices made by Rust won't make all that much of sense as they do today, too.

## 2021-06-16 - Quote of the Week

> If manually managing memory is like wielding a gun, the borrow checker is an automatic safety that prevents you from pulling the trigger when you're roughly pointing it at yourself. But it's coarse-grained and errs on the side of caution; it simulates your foot as as the rectangular box that would contain it, not as a detailed 3D mesh. If you *really* think you can aim it between your toes and avoid hitting yourself (for example, "the value returned by this function must remain alive for no more than 15 successive invocations of this function"), unsafe will let you try, but the borrow checker's built-in rules isn't granular enough to help you, though it will still stop you if you accidentally put your hand in front without declaring it.

## 2021-08-25 - Quote of the Week

> Code doesn't deal with resources until it does. Similarly with everything else that forces you to reason about control flow - you don't care about thread management until you do, you don't care about action logs until you do, you don't care about performance until you do... and from the other side, code doesn't need to be exception-safe until it does. The trouble with this kind of "magic" language feature is that correctness becomes non-compositional: you can take two working pieces of code and put them together and get something that doesn't work.

## 2021-10-06 - Quote of the Week

> There's a common trope among people unfamiliar with rust where they assume that if you use unsafe at all, then it's just as unsafe as C and rust provided no benefit. Comparing C's approach to safety vs Rust's is like comparing an [open world assumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-world_assumption) to a closed world assumption in formal logic systems. In C, you publish your api if it's possible to use correctly (open world). In Rust, you publish a safe api if it's **im** possible to use **in** correctly (closed world). Rust's key innovation here is that it enables you to build a 'bridge' from open world (unsafe) to a closed world (safe), a seemingly impossible feat that feels like somehow pairwise reducing an uncountable infinity with a countable infinity. Rust's decision to design an analogous closed-world assumption for safe code is extremely powerful, but it seems very hard for old school C programmers to wrap their head around it.

## 2021-12-01 - Quote of the Week

> The design of the safe/unsafe split means that there is an asymmetric trust relationship between Safe and Unsafe Rust. Safe Rust inherently has to trust that any Unsafe Rust it touches has been written correctly. On the other hand, Unsafe Rust cannot trust Safe Rust without care.
>
> As an example, Rust has the [`PartialOrd`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/cmp/trait.PartialOrd.html) and [`Ord`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/cmp/trait.Ord.html) traits to differentiate between types which can "just" be compared, and those that provide a "total" ordering (which basically means that comparison behaves reasonably).
>
> [`BTreeMap`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/collections/struct.BTreeMap.html) doesn't really make sense for partially-ordered types, and so it requires that its keys implement `Ord` . However, `BTreeMap` has Unsafe Rust code inside of its implementation. Because it would be unacceptable for a sloppy `Ord` implementation (which is Safe to write) to cause Undefined Behavior, the Unsafe code in BTreeMap must be written to be robust against `Ord` implementations which aren't actually total — even though that's the whole point of requiring `Ord` .

> I've seen similar sentiments echoed before, elsewhere. The point it's making is the same one that's argued whenever people say you should learn LISP because it'll make you a better programmer.
>
> There's no such thing as a perfectly intuitive programming language because algorithmic thinking isn't something that comes to us intuitively. That's why the first language is always the hardest.
>
> It's helpful and mind-expanding to learn new paradigms and force yourself out of old cognitive ruts. Thus, from an "improving your ability to solve problems and function as a programmer" perspective, what makes Rust difficult is valuable because it's forcing you to learn to think about problems in new ways.
>
> That's the distinction between necessary complexity and complexity due to ill-considered design. (Similar to how, in video games, there's a difference between genuine difficulty and difficulty caused by something like a crappy control scheme.)

## 2022-05-11 - Quote of the Week

> At Cloudflare we have big Rust projects/teams and onboard new developers regularly.
>
> There is a learning curve. Rust is rigid and unforgiving, and noobs need assistance when the compiler says “no” (although error messages and Clippy do a good job for common mistakes).
>
> However, the big upside is that noobs can contribute safely to Rust projects. Rust limits severity of the damage an inexperienced programmer can cause. Once they manage to get the code to compile, it already has lots of correctness guarantees. “Bad” Rust code may just clone more than strictly necessary, or write 10 lines of code for something that has a helper method in the stdlib, but it won’t corrupt memory or blindly run the happy path without checking for errors. Rust prefers to be locally explicit, so it’s also easy to review.

## 2022-05-18 - Quote of the Week

> It is worth remembering that there is an infinitely large set of programs but a very small set of useful programs. A programming language is a form of ad-hoc compression algorithm, it is intended to sort the set of useful programs to have shorter encodings than the undesirable ones. Programs with certain categories of error or security vulnerability should be harder or impossible to express.

## 2022-05-25 - Quote of the Week

> This is the difference in approaches of the two languages. In C++ if the code is vulnerable, the blame is on the programmer. In Rust if the code is vulnerable, Rust considers it a failure of the language, and takes responsibility to stop even “bad” programmers from writing vulnerable code. I can’t stress enough how awesome it is that I can be a careless fool, and still write perfectly robust highly multi-threaded code that never crashes.

> I wrote a bespoke time-series database in Rust a few years ago, and it has had exactly one issue since I stood it up in production, and that was due to pessimistic filesystem access patterns, rather than the language. This thing is handling hundreds of thousands of inserts per second, and it's even threaded.
>
> Given that I've been programming professionally for over a decade in Python, Perl, Ruby, C, C++, Javascript, Java, and Rust, I'll pick Rust absolutely any time that I want something running that I won't get called at 3 AM to fix. It probably took me 5 times as long to write it as if I did it in Go or Python, but I guarantee it's saved me 10 times as much time I would have otherwise spent triaging, debugging, and running disaster recovery.

## 2022-06-15 - Quote of the Week

> Because lower-level software has more operational constraints than higher-level software (e.g. it typically cannot tolerate a runtime or memory management via garbage collection), developing a memory safe language suitable for systems software is particularly challenging. The Rust language has met that challenge, however, and is an excellent candidate for replacing C in many systems applications.
>
> We plan to invest in the tools that allow systems engineers to move their software to Rust. This means investing in improving package management, compilers, and Foreign Function Interface (FFI) generators. In many cases this will include providing interfaces compatible with existing widely-used components to enable transition. With these tools, adoption of a memory safe alternative will scale much faster without replication of efforts.

> If there’s one lesson from decades of software engineering, it is the failure of “just be careful” as a strategy. C/C++ programmers still experience memory corruption constantly, no matter how careful they are. Java programmers still frequently see NullPointerExceptions, no matter how careful they are. And so on. One of the reasons that Rust is so successful is that it adds automated checks to prevent many common mistakes.

> \[W\]e reached a tipping point. **We decided to move our entire codebase to Rust**... . Rust seemed to give us all the capabilities we needed, **however, there was still one *minor* problem - no one on the team knew Rust.** ...
>
> We started with a small team of senior engineers and managers learning Rust and developing the skeleton of the DB and dev environment (for others to build on). Then, slowly, others joined in rewriting and contributing different components until we eventually got rid of the old codebase altogether (I still remember the day my original C modules, from the first days of Pinecone, were taken out). Unbeknownst to most Pinecone customers, the new Rust core was deployed in March this year. And in the process of taking over running workloads, we managed not to drop a single API call!
>
> ... **We all expect\[ed\] performance and dev processes to improve. Those indeed happened.** What we didn’t expect was the extent to which dev velocity increased and operational incidents decreased. **Dev velocity** ... **improved dramatically with Rust. Built-in testing, CI/CD, benchmarking, and an overzealous compiler increased engineers’ confidence in pushing changes, and enabled them to work on the same code sections and contribute simultaneously without breaking the code base.** Most impressively though, **real time operational events dropped almost to zero overnight after the original release.** Sure, there are still surprises here and there but, by and large, the core engine has been shockingly stable and predictable.

## 2023-01-18 - Quote of the Week

> Common arguments against Rust's safety guarantees:
>
> * The library you're binding to can have a segfault in it.
> * RAM can physically fail, causing dangling pointers.
> * The computer the Rust program is running on can be hit by a meteorite.
> * Alan Turing can come back from the dead and tell everyone that he actually made up computer science and none of it is real, thus invalidating every program ever made, including all Rust programs.

## 2023-01-25 - Quote of the Week

> Rust has demonstrated that you using a type system as a vehicle for separation logic works, even in imperative languages, and it's nothing as arcane as those immutable functional predecessors would suggest. It did this by making sure the language defines a type system that helps you, by making sure core properties of soundness *can* be expressed in it.
>
> * soundness requirement for memory access: lifetimes
> * soundness requirements for references *with* value semantics: > `&`/`&mut _`
> * soundness requirements for resources: `Copy` and `Drop`
> * making sure your logic is monotic: traits instead of inheritance, lack of specialization (yes, that's a *feature*).
> * (notably missing: no dependent types; apparently not 'necessary' but I'm sure it could be useful; however, research is heavily ongoing; caution is good)
>
> This allows the standard library to encode all of its relevant requirements as types. And doing this everywhere is its soundness property: safe functions have no requirements beyond the sum of its parameter type, `unsafe functions` can. Nothing new or special there, nothing that makes Rust's notion of soundness special.
>
> Basing your mathematical reasoning on separation logic makes soundness reviews *local* instead of requiring whole program analysis. This is what makes it practical. It did this pretty successfully and principled, but did no single truly revolutionary thing. It's a sum of good bits from the last decade of type system research. That's probably why people refer to it as 'the soundness definition', it's just a very poignant way to say: "we learned that a practical type systems works as a proof checker".

> The generated program is a random sequence of bytes that just happens to take the shape of a seemingly working program by accident. Such is the joy of code that causes UB. You cannot deduce anything from what happens when you execute a program with UB, since that act is by itself meaningless. You need to establish that your program has no UB before making any inference based on what you see the program do after it came out of the compiler.

> That said, I really like the language. It’s as if someone set out to design a programming language, and just picked all the right answers. Great ecosystem, flawless cross platform, built-in build tools, no “magic”, static binaries, performance-focused, built-in concurrency checks. Maybe these “correct” choices are just laser-targeted at my soul, but in my experience, once you leap over the initial hurdles, it all just works™️, without much fanfare.

## 2023-05-03 - Quote of the Week

> Since it hasn't been said before, there is an important distinction that needs to be addressed. For anyone who has been doing embedded work for any length of time and hasn't yet been exposed to Rust, the only thing that can really be said is that the language is entirely unlike everything you've experienced before. There is just nothing comparable, and the only way to rationalize questions like *why use Rust at all* is to put some honest effort into learning and using it.
>
> Hearing things like "it's a bit like C++ except it's memory safe and thread safe, and it's actually practical to build kernels with it" will not sound convincing. You have to see it to believe it.
>
> It's as if you've spent an entire career writing assembly, and one day you hear something or other about a brand-new programming language claiming to be a "portable assembler" called C. It sounds too good to be true. And then the years pass, and all of the mystery and disbelief gives way to obviousness and precision engineering. That's sort of how it is when going from C to Rust.

> I guess the nicest example of this phenomenon is shared mutability. Programmers have been arguing for decades whether it is sharing xor mutability that causes memory safety bugs:

> * "It's threads!" – shouted JavaScript and Python, and JS remained single-threaded, and Python introduced the GIL.
> * "It's mutability!" – screamed Haskell and Erlang, and they made (almost) everything immutable.
>
> And then along came Rust, and said: "you are fools! You can have both sharing and mutability in the same language, as long as you isolate them from each other."

## 2023-09-06 - Quote of the Week

> Rusts standard library, and a lot of the popular crates, are like a museum. While it does change, as new exhibitions are added, it is mostly finished. Each painting has a detailed explanation in 7 different languages underneath. Descriptions below each excitation are written beautifully, with detailed drawings, showing how everything works. It is so easy to navigate, one glance at the map is enough to find exactly what you are looking for. It is so convenient, you almost don't notice that you are learning something.
>
> Internals of `rustc` are like a build site of a sprawling factory. You can see the scaffolds everywhere, as more production lines come online, and everything gets faster, better, bigger. Workers move around, knowing the place like the back of their hands. They can glance at the signs on the walls, and instantly tell you: where you are, what this place does and what pitfalls you should avoid. And you are a new hire who has just came for his first day at the new job. You look at the sign, and after some thinking, you too are able to tell roughly in which building you are. The signs almost always tell you what you need, just in short, cryptic sentences. You always can tell what is going on, with some thinking, but it is not effortless. The signs on the walls are not *bad*, just not written for anyone to get right away.

## 2023-11-01 - Quote of the Week

> After doing a best fit, we found Rust projects were less likely to introduce vulnerabilities than their equivalent C++ projects at all relevant experience levels, but more importantly, we found the effect was most significant for first-time contributors, who were almost two orders of magnitude less likely to contribute vulnerabilities. That is, even though Rust may have a reputation as a harder language to learn, there is a very measurable effect that makes it better for newbies. Reviewers should not have to put as much effort into reviewing code to be confident that someone making their first foray into their project is accidentally adding a vulnerability.

> For Binder to continue to meet Android's needs, we need better ways to manage (and reduce!) complexity without increasing the risk.
>
> The biggest change is obviously the choice of programming language. We decided to use Rust because it directly addresses a number of the challenges within Binder that we have faced during the last years.

## 2023-12-06 - Quote of the Week

> NVIDIA's firmware, Airlie said, comes with a set of include files that, in turn, define structures that change over time. To deal with these changes, the driver is going to need some sort of automated ABI generation; he noted that the developers working on the Apple M1 GPU driver have run into the same problem. This problem could be made easier to tackle, he suggested, if the driver were, like the M1 driver, to be rewritten in Rust.

## 2023-12-20 - Quote of the Week

> The Tianyi-33 satellite is a 50kg class space science experimental satellite equipped with an operating system independently developed by Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications—the Rust-based dual-kernel real-time operating system **RROS**. RROS will carry out general tasks represented by tensorflow/k8s and real-time tasks represented by real-time file systems and real-time network transmission on the satellite. It will ensure the normal execution of upper-layer applications and scientific research tasks, such as time-delay measurement between satellite and ground, live video broadcasting, onboard web chat services, pseudo-SSH experiments, etc. This marks the world’s first official application of a Rust-written dual-kernel operating system in a satellite scenario.

## 2023-12-27 - Quote of the Week

> Rust can be rather more verbose than C; there are a lot of invariants that have to be expressed in the code. But that is countered by the need for far less error-handling code; it turns out to be a wash, with the size of the two implementations being about the same.

## 2024-01-31 - Quote of the Week

> The sheer stability of this program is what made me use rust for everything going forward. The social-service has a 100% uptime for almost 2.5 years now. It’s processed 12.9TB of traffic and is still using 1.5mb of ram just like the day we ran it 2.5 years ago. The resource usage is so low it brings tears to my eyes. As someone who came from Java, the lack of OOM errors or GC problems has been a huge benefit of rust and I don’t ever see myself using any other programming language. I’m a big fan of the mindset “build it once, but build it the right way” which is why rust is always my choice.

## 2024-02-07 - Quote of the Week

> My take on this is that you cannot use async Rust correctly and fluently without understanding Arc, Mutex, the mutability of variables/references, and how async and await syntax compiles in the end. Rust forces you to understand how and why things are the way they are. It gives you minimal abstraction to do things that could’ve been tedious to do yourself.
> 
> I got a chance to work on two projects that drastically forced me to understand how async/await works. The first one is to transform a library that is completely sync and only requires a sync trait to talk to the outside service. This all sounds fine, right? Well, this becomes a problem when we try to port it into browsers. The browser is single-threaded and cannot block the JavaScript runtime at all! It is arguably the most weird environment for Rust users. It is simply impossible to rewrite the whole library, as it has already been shipped to production on other platforms.
> 
> What we did instead was rewrite the network part using async syntax, but using our own generator. The idea is simple: the generator produces a future when called, and the produced future can be awaited. But! The produced future contains an arc pointer to the generator. That means we can feed the generator the value we are waiting for, then the caller who holds the reference to the generator can feed the result back to the function and resume it. For the browser, we use the native browser API to derive the network communications; for other platforms, we just use regular blocking network calls. The external interface remains unchanged for other platforms.
> 
> Honestly, I don’t think any other language out there could possibly do this. Maybe C or C++, but which will never have the same development speed and developer experience.
> 
> I believe people have already mentioned it, but the current asynchronous model of Rust is the most reasonable choice. It does create pain for developers, but on the other hand, there is no better asynchronous model for Embedded or WebAssembly.

## 2024-02-14 - Quote of the Week

> For some weird reason the Elixir Discord community has a distinct lack of programmer-socks-wearing queer furries, at least compared to Rust, or even most other tech-y Discord servers I’ve seen. It caused some weird cognitive dissonance. Why do I feel vaguely strange hanging out online with all these kind, knowledgeable, friendly and compassionate techbro’s? Then I see a name I recognized from elsewhere and my hindbrain goes “oh thank gods, I know for a fact she’s actually a snow leopard in her free time”. Okay, this nitpick is firmly tongue-in-cheek, but the Rust user-base continues to be a fascinating case study in how many weirdos you can get together in one place when you very explicitly say it’s ok to be a weirdo.

## 2024-03-06 - Quote of the Week

> My experience with C++ is that, as I’ve become more of an expert in the language, I’ve become more disillusioned with it. It’s incredibly hard to do things that you should be able to do in software. And, it’s a huge problem for me to constantly be helping other engineers debug the same bugs over and over. It’s always another use after free. I’ve probably debugged 300 of those. \[...\]
>
> In our experience using the Rust ecosystem for almost three years now, I don't think we found a bug in a single Rust crate that we've pulled off the shelf. We found a bug in one of them and that was a Rust crate wrapping a C library and the bug was in the C library. The software quality that you kind of get for free is amazing.
